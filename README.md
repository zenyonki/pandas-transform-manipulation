# 🏡 Data Transformation and Manipulation with Pandas

This project showcases the use of Python and the Pandas library to explore, clean, transform, and analyze real-world data from a property rental platform (e.g., Airbnb). The goal is to assist hosts in setting optimal daily rates for their properties based on a range of features and market demand.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build an algorithm that analyzes key property attributes — such as amenities, size, and occupancy trends — and recommends daily pricing strategies that maximize revenue during high-demand periods.
